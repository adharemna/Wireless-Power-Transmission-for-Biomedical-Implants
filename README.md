# Wireless Power Transmission for Biomedical Implants

## Overview
Wireless Power Transmission for Biomedical Implants is a project developed as part of the TIPE (Travaux d'Initiative Personnelle Encadrés) exam for admission to French engineering schools during the academic year 2021-2022. The project focuses on the transmission of electrical power wirelessly for biomedical implants, with a specific emphasis on health and prevention.

## Description
The project aims to explore and enhance the efficiency of wireless power transmission for biomedical implants, ultimately striving to eliminate the need for surgical operations to replace batteries in medical devices such as cardiac implants. Through a combination of experimental and theoretical approaches, various coupling methods were investigated, including non-resonant and resonant coupling techniques.

## Experimental Success
At resonant frequencies, the efficiency reaches 8, equivalent to 800%, confirming the success of the experiment and the project.

## Content
The presentation PDF file, detailing the project's objectives, methods, results, and conclusions, is available for review. It provides a comprehensive overview of the project's scope, methodologies, and outcomes. Also a documentation file is available, it outlines the thematic positioning, bibliographic commentary, selected keywords, problem statement, objectives, and bibliographic references associated with the project.

## Acknowledgments
We would like to acknowledge the support and guidance provided by our academic advisors and mentors throughout the duration of this project. Additionally, we express gratitude to the academic institution IPEST (Institut Préparatoire aux Études Scientifiques et Techniques) that facilitated access to resources and facilities necessary for conducting experiments and research.
